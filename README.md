# Exploratory Data Analysis Course Project 2

David Mallard, May 2015

This repository has my code and output for the second course project in Coursera's Exploratory Data Analysis course.

The overall goal of this assignment is to explore the National Emissions Inventory database and see what it say about fine particulate matter pollution in the United states over the 10-year period 1999â€“2008. You may use any R package you want to support your analysis.

## Requirements

* Developed and tested using R 3.2.0 with RStudio 0.99 preview.
* The `dplyr` and `ggplot2` packages must be installed.

## About the project

`get-data.R` downloads and unzips the data from the course website. It must be run once after cloning the repository or the main scripts won't work.

`plot1.R` through `plot6.R` contain the full code to manipulate the data and generate a plot that answers the corresponding question. Each plot is saved as a PNG file.

For more information about the data, see the [EPA National Emissions Inventory web site.](http://www.epa.gov/ttn/chief/eiinformation.html)
